## Description

Pomodoro Timer is a project based on the pomodoro technique developed by the author [Francesco Cirillo](https://www-pomodorotechnique-com.translate.goog/the-pomodoro-technique-book/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt&_x_tr_pto=tc). The objective of this project was to design a system focused on increasing productivity and focus.

The application operates in the system tray, providing discreet access to timer controls and settings. Users can customize the length of work periods and breaks, set up sound alerts, and review their session history through detailed logs.
